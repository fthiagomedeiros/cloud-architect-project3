# Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an ssh brute force attack from the internet.

1. Remove the inbound rule related to SSH connection.
22	tcp	0.0.0.0/0	✔  

2. Change for known specific IP that can access to the instance.
22	tcp	87.9.181.77/32	✔
This change makes ssh connection to the instance allowed just for 187.9.181.77/32, which is a known IP. It means the instance is just accessible from this IP.

3. Change the instance to a private subnet and allows only internal traffic. If SSH access is necessary, define a bastion with restrictive access to the internet or use SSM Session Manager

# Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket, in the even that instance API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data.

AWS Best Practices specify you must define least privilege access.
The instance has the policy below, which is permissive and give access to any s3 bucket.

      Policies:
        - PolicyName: InstanceRolePolicy-C3
          PolicyDocument:
            Version: 2012-10-17
            Statement:
              - Effect: Allow
                Action: 's3:*'
                Resource: '*'
                
Encrypt the bucket using a KMS Key. Encryption is an effective way to protect data in a S3 bucket.
