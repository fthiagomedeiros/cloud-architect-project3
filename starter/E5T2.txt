# Identify tools that will allow you to do the following:

## Scan infrastructure as code templates

As I used in the template DevSecOpsPipeline.png, Prisma Cloud is a tool for scanning terraform or cloudformation templates (https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/prisma-cloud-devops-security/secure-your-infrastructure-automation.html)

### Example vulnerability

The vulnerabilities that tools scanning IaC templates are related to permissive policies, IAM Policies in template etc.

##Scan AMIâ€™s or containers for OS vulnerabilities

Anchore scanning for Dockerfile image scan or AWS Inspector for AMI scanning.
Another third party tools are Tenable Nessus, Rapid7 Nexpose, Qualys Cloud Platform

### Example vulnerability

These tools must be able to detect vulnerabilities in SO level or remote root login being enabled or or vulnerable software versions installed

##Scan an AWS environment for cloud configuration vulnerabilities

Amazon Inspector enables you to analyze the behavior of your AWS resources and helps you identify potential security issues.

### Example vulnerability

Amazon Inspector automatically assesses applications for exposure, vulnerabilities, and deviations from best practices. After performing an assessment, Amazon Inspector produces a detailed list of security findings prioritized by level of severity.
